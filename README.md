# Color-Recognition-Python
Code to recognize the color of any pixel in a provided image.

I have provided a *good* image, to test the code on.
To run the code on your machine, make sure that you have latest version of python installed.
and then,
type this in your terminal CLI: 

```
python my_color_detection.py -i gaytiger.png
```

The image will be displayed in a new window. You can double-click anywhere in the image and see the Color-name of that pixel.
